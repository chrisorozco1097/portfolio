      "summary": "Conducted a systematic mapping literature review analyzing 69 studies across five academic databases to assess how educational institutions address sexual and gender diversity. The study revealed a global lack of LGBTQ+ representation in curricula, limited use of technological tools, and a concentration of inclusive efforts within healthcare programs—especially scarce in Latin America. Findings highlight the positive impact of inclusive education on the LGBTQ+ community and the urgent need for broader, structured curricular integration."

Four approaches using LEGO®, NAO, and Hexapod robots were implemented across primary and higher education in STEM and physical education settings. Results demonstrated that robotic-assisted instruction significantly improved students’ attention span, motivation, and information retention, offering a dynamic alternative to conventional teaching."

In collaboration with a rehabilitation institute in Mexico City, the project fostered empathy, patient interaction, and the development of a functional rehabilitation tool. Usability and reproducibility assessments, including Cronbach’s alpha, showed strong engagement and approval from both patients and medical staff."
