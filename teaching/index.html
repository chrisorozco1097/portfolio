Motivated by the lack of academic resources in rural communities, I started a mathematics training program at Nezahualcóyotl Secondary School, where I had studied years before. The goal was to identify promising students from seventh to ninth grade and provide them with high-level math instruction aimed at preparing them for academic competitions at the regional and state level.</p> <h4>Program Structure and Methodology</h4> <p>The program was designed with structured phases:</p> <ul> <li>Annual diagnostic evaluations to select the most talented students across all grades.</li> <li>After-school sessions focused on mathematical problem-solving, logic, and critical thinking.</li> <li>Mock exams and competitive drills to build resilience under pressure and familiarity with competition formats.</li> <li>Focus on theory combined with interactive learning techniques to maintain engagement.</li> </ul> <h4>Impact and Results</h4> <p>The program had an immediate effect:</p> <ul> <li>In its first year, the school earned its highest performance in state competitions, with six out of nine students earning medals.</li> <li>Regular participation in multiple contests elevated the academic profile of the school and gave students access to broader opportunities.</li> <li>Students developed not only academic skills but also soft skills like perseverance, confidence, and teamwork.</li> </ul> <h4>Expanding My Impact: Líderes del Mañana Scholarship</h4> <p>These early community efforts contributed to me earning the Líderes del Mañana scholarship from Tecnológico de Monterrey, Mexico's top private university. The program selects students based on academic excellence and community leadership, granting them a full scholarship to pursue higher education. This opportunity allowed me to expand my teaching projects and gain new skills in leadership and social impact.</p> <h4>Founding CreateMath</h4> <p>With access to university resources, I formalized my teaching into CreateMath, a student-led initiative focused on democratizing access to competitive math education. CreateMath became a multi-year, multi-location outreach project with a broad scope.</p> <div class="row justify-content-center mt-4"> <div class="col-md-12 mb-3 d-flex justify-content-center"> <img src="/portfolio/assets/img/teaching/CM_founders.jpg" alt="CreateMath State Competition" class="img-fluid rounded shadow-sm" style="max-height: 45vh; object-fit: cover;"> </div> </div> <div class="caption text-center mt-2"> CreateMath founding members. </div> <h4>Achievements of CreateMath</h4> <ul> <li>Reached over 300 students from elementary, middle, and high schools.</li> <li>Established collaborations with six different schools across Jalisco, customizing programs according to local needs.</li> <li>Weekly training sessions supplemented by weekend workshops and intensive sessions before competitions.</li> <li>Regular mock exams and leaderboard systems to encourage healthy competition and academic growth.</li> <li>Personalized mentorship programs connecting university students with young learners.</li> </ul> <div class="row justify-content-center mt-4"> <div class="col-md-12 mb-3 d-flex justify-content-center"> <img src="/portfolio/assets/img/teaching/CM_group.jpg" alt="CreateMath Group" class="img-fluid rounded shadow-sm" style="max-height: 45vh; object-fit: cover;"> </div> </div> <div class="caption text-center mt-2"> CreateMath group picture, Jalisco's state math competition 2017. </div> <h4>Organizing Large-Scale Competitions</h4> <p>One of the highlights of CreateMath was the organization of two state-level mathematics competitions hosted at Tecnológico de Monterrey:</p> <ul> <li>Each event welcomed around 200 students from diverse municipalities in Jalisco.</li> <li>The competitions included in place evaluation with instructor from across the participating schools to provide transparency.</li> <li>We created an in-house competitive environment, organizing a large-scale event bigger than any student organization before.</li> </ul> <h4>Skills Gained and Long-Term Impact</h4> <p>This experience helped me develop leadership, project management, and curriculum development skills. It reinforced my dedication to education as a tool for social transformation. Even after graduation, the methods and materials from CreateMath have continued to be used by other volunteers, leaving a lasting impact on hundreds of students.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <hr> <h1 id="final-reflections">Final Reflections</h1> <p>Across every stage of my teaching journey — from grassroots math coaching in local schools to advanced university instruction and prestigious international programs — I have developed a versatile and adaptive teaching style grounded in engagement, creativity, and real-world application.</p> <p>These experiences have not only strengthened my technical teaching abilities but have also shaped my communication style, leadership approach, and capacity to design transformative educational experiences that reach diverse audiences in both in-person and remote environments.</p> <p>One of the principles that defines my teaching philosophy is witnessing the long-term success of my students. In my young career, I have already had the privilege of seeing many of my former students go on to achieve their academic and professional goals — from graduating in a wide range of university programs to some now pursuing graduate and doctorate-level studies. Observing their progress is a continuous reminder of the positive ripple effect that education can have on individuals and communities.</p> <p>Above all, teaching remains one of the most fulfilling and meaningful aspects of my professional life. I am always excited to seek out new challenges, create engaging learning environments, and continue contributing to the personal and academic growth of others.</p> <div class="row justify-content-center mt-4"> <div class="col-md-12 mb-3 d-flex justify-content-center"> <img src="/portfolio/assets/img/teaching/CM_FirstGroup.jpg" alt="CreateMath First Group" class="img-fluid rounded shadow-sm" style="max-height: 45vh; object-fit: cover;"> </div> </div> <div class="caption text-center mt-2"> The origin, celebrating our historical 6-medal accomplishment in 2013. </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Christian Orozco.
